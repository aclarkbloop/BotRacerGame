# BOT-O-MAT
Hello Red Ventures Engineers! I had so much fun creating this project and I hope you enjoy it!

## Instructions for running the Bot Racer 1.0
First, if you do not already have a JDK downloaded on your computer, you can follow this link to 
download the latest version of Java: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

From here there are two options:

1. Clone the repository, find the BotGame.java file, and run this file in an IDE. (I use Eclipse).
	
2. Download the runnable jar file, 'bot-o-mat_runnable.jar', to your computer. From the command line, navigate to the directory in which the file was downloaded and run the command:

					java -jar bot-o-mat_runnable.jar

In both cases, you should expect to see a pink window pop up along with a dialogue box prompting you to 
select the number of robots you want to build. 

Happy Bot-ing!! :)
