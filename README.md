# BOT-O-MAT
Hello Red Ventures Engineers! I had so much fun creating this project and I hope you enjoy it!

##Instructions for running the Bot Racer 1.0
First, if you do not already have a JDK downloaded on your computer, you can follow this link to 
download the latest version of Java: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

From here there are two options:

1. Clone the repository, find the RobotGame.java file, and run this file in an IDE. 
	
2. Simply download the runnable jar file and open it from your computer's file finder window. 

In both cases, you should expect to see a pink window pop up along with a dialogue box prompting you to 
select the number of robots you want to build.
